  Print only the names of hidden dotfiles (files starting with a dot) in the
  current directory, non-recursive, one per line, sorted lexicographically.
  Exclude "." and "..", and exclude directories (only regular files).
  Do not include size/permissions; just filenames.

  Working directory will contain various files/dirs including hidden ones.

  Examples of valid outputs:
    .env
    .gitignore
tags: ["ls", "find", "glob", "shell"]
